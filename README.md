Spotify Listening Analytics Dashboard

A Power BI Project by Deepika Boominathan

This project analyzes my complete Spotify listening history and visualizes key trends across Albums, Artists, and Tracks.
The dashboard highlights how my listening behavior has changed over time, which genres and artists I prefer, and how weekday vs weekend patterns differ.

Project Overview

Using Power BI, I cleaned, transformed, and visualized Spotify streaming data to understand long-term listening habits. The dashboard contains interactive segments for:

Albums Played Over Time

Artists Discovered & Played

Tracks Played Across Years

Year-over-Year Comparisons

Top Artists, Albums, and Tracks

Weekday vs Weekend Listening Patterns

Filters for platform, shuffle mode, skipped status, etc.

Key Insights
1. Listening Peak in 2021

All three categories—albums, artists, and tracks—show a major spike in 2021, indicating my highest music engagement during that year.

2. Decrease in Recent Years

From 2022–2024, there is a noticeable decline in:

Albums played (-19.66% YoY)

Artists explored (-27.06% YoY)

Tracks played (-7.98% YoY)

This suggests a shift toward more focused or repeated listening (playlists/podcasts) rather than exploring new music.

3. Classic Rock Dominates

My top artists and albums are heavily influenced by classic rock, especially:

The Beatles (10K+ plays)

John Mayer

Bob Dylan

Pink Floyd albums like The Wall and Revolver

4. Weekend Listening Is Higher

Across all categories, weekend streaming slightly exceeds weekday usage, showing that I listen more during leisure time.
